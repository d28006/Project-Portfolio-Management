1. Project Title / Headline

📅 Project Portfolio Timeline Dashboard: Multi-Year Insights on Progress, Cost, and Benefits
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor organizational projects across multiple years, track progress by phase, measure completion against benefits, and enable executives to prioritize resources effectively.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Project Portfolio Timeline Dashboard provides a consolidated view of project lifecycles, progress, and performance. It allows managers and executives to:

Monitor timelines by phase (Explore, Develop, Plan, Implement, Measure).

Track project performance (cost, benefit, completion %).

Compare progress across regions, project types, and managers.

Identify risks and stalled initiatives to improve resource allocation.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for visualization and interactive reporting
• 🔄 Power Query (M) – For extracting, cleaning, and transforming project portfolio data
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For KPI calculations like completion %, benefit vs cost ratios
• 🧩 Data Modeling – Linking project attributes (region, type, manager, timeline) into a structured model
• 🗄 SQL Database – Backend data store for project portfolio details before integration
• 💻 SQL (SELECT, JOIN, Aggregates) – Used for preparing historical and ongoing project datasets
• 📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project), shareable as reports or images

4. Data Source

Source: Project portfolio dataset covering 2021–2025.

The dataset includes:

Project details: name, type (income generation, process improvement, cost reduction, etc.)

Project attributes: region, manager, complexity level

Timeline: start date, end date, current phase

Financials: cost vs projected benefits

Progress indicators: completion %, current status (In Progress, Complete, On Hold, Cancelled)

5. Features / Highlights

Business Problem
Organizations often struggle to track multiple projects simultaneously, making it difficult to allocate resources, assess ROI, and ensure strategic alignment.

Goal of the Dashboard
To provide leadership with:

A multi-year timeline view of all projects

Insights into completion vs benefits

Ability to filter by region, type, manager, and year

Transparency into project health and blockers

6. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Total Projects Over Time (Line Chart)
Tracks the number of projects initiated and active between 2021–2025, highlighting seasonal/project cycle fluctuations.

Project Timeline (Gantt View)
Displays individual project phases (Explore → Develop → Plan → Implement → Measure), giving a clear roadmap of execution and overlap across initiatives.

Detailed Project Table (Matrix View)
Columns include:

Project Name, Type, Region, Manager, Complexity

Start & End Dates

Project Cost vs Benefit

Completion % and Status (color-coded: In Progress, Complete, On Hold, Cancelled)

7. Business Impact & Insights

📊 Project Volume Fluctuations: Peaks in 2021, 2022, and 2023 highlight cyclical project activity. Strategic planning is needed for staffing and resource alignment.

💰 ROI Transparency: Cost-benefit comparison across projects enables leadership to prioritize high-value initiatives.

⚠️ Risk Identification: Several projects are on hold or cancelled despite significant costs, signaling potential inefficiencies.

🎯 Strategic Oversight: Regional and managerial filters allow executives to drill down into performance accountability and resource utilization.

✅ Improved Governance: Completion % and phase tracking make it easier to measure execution against strategic goals.
